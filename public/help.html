    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    Copy the link in the address bar including the room number to someone so they can join the room. There are 3 possible video source methods that can be used:
    <h3>1. YouTube</h3>
    Paste a youtube url into the input bar and press enter or click the stream button.
    <h3>2. Direct links to video files</h3>
    Paste a url of a video stored on an http server publicly. Such as <u>https://example.com/video.mp4</u>
    Note that a webpage which has a video on it isn't necessarily the link to that video.
    In this case the file needs to be encoded with a format supported by the browser such as <i>.mp4</i> or <i>.webm</i>.
    They also need to be http streamable as not all mp4 files are streamable.

    <h3>3. Local video files</h3>
    Drag-and-drop a video file encoded with a supported format by the browser.<br>
    In this case everyone in the room needs to drag-and-drop their local copy of the same file before starting.
